# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Firebase Setup

This application uses Firebase Firestore to store and manage cultivar data. To run the application with Firebase integration, you need to:

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** If you haven't already, create a project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Enable Firestore:** In your Firebase project, enable Firestore. Start in "test mode" for easy initial setup, but remember to configure proper security rules for production.
3.  **Get Firebase Configuration:**
    *   Go to your Firebase project settings.
    *   Under "Your apps", click on the "Web" icon (`</>`) to add a web app (if you haven't already).
    *   Register your app and Firebase will provide you with a configuration object.
4.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (if it doesn't exist).
    *   Copy the Firebase configuration values into this file, matching the keys provided in the `.env` file:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id (optional)
        ```
5.  **Seed Initial Data (Manual):**
    *   The application expects a Firestore collection named `cultivars`.
    *   You will need to manually add your initial cultivar data into this collection. You can use the structure from the (now removed) `src/lib/mock-data.ts`'s `mockCultivars` array as a template for your documents. Each cultivar object should be a document in the `cultivars` collection. The document ID can be auto-generated by Firestore or you can set custom ones if preferred (though the app is set up to handle Firestore auto-generated IDs for new additions).

Once these steps are completed, the application should be able to connect to your Firebase project and manage cultivar data in Firestore.
